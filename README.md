# Airbnb Carousel Clone

I built this project from scratch to clone an Airbnb product page carousel. It displays an array of 12 houses, showing 4 houses at a time, and rotates continuously between the first and last turn cycles when clicked. Made with Express, React, and Node, and deployed using Amazon EC2.

## Live Demo Links

  - Carousel: http://18.222.249.216:1985/rooms/80/
  - Proxy: http://3.128.186.14:3000/rooms/80/

## Setup on Local

1. git clone
1. install dependencies with `npm install`
1. start server with `npm run start`
1. view at PORT/rooms/:id (for id values 0-99)

For setup with proxy, complete steps above and follow steps for [proxy](https://github.com/FEC-corgis/Jenny-Proxy).
