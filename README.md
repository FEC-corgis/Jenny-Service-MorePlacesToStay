# Airbnb Carousel Clone

I built this project from scratch to clone an Airbnb product page carousel. It displays an array of 12 houses, showing 4 houses at a time, and rotates continuously between the first and last turn cycles when clicked. Made with Express, React, and Node, and deployed using Amazon EC2.
